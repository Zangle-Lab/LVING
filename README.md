# LVING : a tool for computing intracellular growth dynamics

<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Lagrangian velocimetry for intracellular net growth (LVING) provides high resolution maps of intracellular biomass production and degradation. LVING uses quantitative phase imaging (QPI) measurements of cell mass and the intracellular velocity of mass transport to quantify the balance of growth and degradation within intracellular control volumes.

For details of computation and various applications of LVING, checkout the preprint on [biorXiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.08.553132). The following applications are demonstrated:

* intracellular growth mapping during various stages of cell cycle
* modes of growth inhibition in cells during chemotherapy
* biomass degradation in cells during autophagy
